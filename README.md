# Miniature Arcade Arduino

**Arduino project with LED and LCD animations**

## Overview

Miniature Arcade Arduino is a lights pattern sketch for your Arduino miniature arcade. This project uses a 74HC595 shift register to control multiple LED animations. The LED patterns are stored in two arrays:

- `chip1Pattern`: Patterns for Chip 1.
- `chip2`: Patterns for Chip 2.

## Features

- Multiple LED animations (Red, Green, Yellow, White, and more)
- Easy-to-modify patterns and animations
- Uses a 74HC595 shift register for LED control

## Setup

1. **Hardware**: Connect your Arduino to a 74HC595 shift register and the LED/LCD components.
2. **Software**: Upload the `Miniature-Arcade-Arduino.ino` sketch to your Arduino.
3. **Run**: Enjoy dynamic light patterns and animations on your miniature arcade!
